I'm interested in the strategies humans deploy to imbue signs with sense, and the shared cultural, sociological, and cognitive priors that allow them to do so. [White Flag Typography](https://sophiaburnett.github.io/Burnett_White%20Flag%20Typography_2024.pdf) my Ph.D thesis supervised by [Julien Longhi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KKt7T4kAAAAJ&hl=fr) and defended in December 2023, proposes a typology of 6 usages of non-standard minuscules in digitally mediated communication, in particular the non-standard 1SG. It draws on a wide interdisciplinary and theoretical base, applying notions such as prosody, indexicality, enregisterment, and iconicity, and combining them with elements of cognitive theory and social psychology to provide a usage profile for each of the six taxa. Jury member and examiner Julie Neveux (Sorbonne) remarked "la thèse soumise par Sophia Burnett est bienvenue car elle contribue à ce domaine scientifique en plein développement"/"The thesis submitted by Sophia Burnett is a welcome contribution to this rapidly developing scientific field"/. And Jürgen Spitzmüller (Vienna) wrote "The thesis is a very valuable contribution to grapholinguistics, the sociolinguistics of writing and research into digitally mediated (meta-)discourse." <br> 

Since autumn 2024, I have been a **Teaching and Research Associate (ATER), last year at Université de Lorraine & Laboratoire IDEA, and this year since 1st September at l'Université de Toulouse**. For research I am affiliated with [LAIRDIL](https://lairdil.univ-tlse3.fr/burnett-sophia) laboratory. I am also associate member of Laboratoire AGORA, CY Cergy Paris.<br>

**Current research:** <br> 
- Organizer of the Human Inside research group and project, which is a slow science, multinigual and interdisciplinary examination of the post-edition of computer generated texts, to understand what we think makes a text 'human. An ongoing open corpus multilingual project. As English lead and former french lead: Exploration of a contrastive French corpus of hybrid human/AI texts to develop a framework for the locus of human embodied discourse. 
- Digital discourse analysis and hermeneutic. 
- Embodied Syntax and Intersubjectivity in Multilingual Ecologies. EU proposal with [Anna Cardinaletti](https://www.unive.it/data/people/5591509). <br>

**Previously:** <br> Classically trained, I was a professional dancer for fifteen years before joining la Sorbonne Paris 1 │ le Conservatoire Européen d'Ecriture Audiovisuelle to study French screenwriting. I then worked as a script doctor and translator for film, TV, theatre, and advertising, and also published a couple of novels, one of which, a historical fiction titled  ['A Useless Mouth'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Useless-Mouth-Philippa-Knight-trilogy/dp/1731374046) was studied by International section lycéen.nes in France.

**Also:** <br> I have recently got into running after years of loathing, by unleashing the power of music and bpm, with which I am able to trick my brain into thinking we are using the body in a very linear--albeit repetitive--form of dance.  My average pace is 6'30", but post-race pizza is universal.

//<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

//* My R package `praatpicture` is now [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/praatpicture/index.html){target='_blank'} and can be installed in R with the usual `install.packages('praatpicture')` command! This package uses base R functionality to make flexible plots and animations of speech audio, derived signals, and annotations. The package comes with extensive documentation and the `README` file provides example code and plots for most of the functionality. The freshest updates will still be available [on GitHub](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture){target='_blank'} before on CRAN, but I'm hoping that this can help spread the word further.

//* I just got a back from a great week in Stockholm, where I first went to [*Phonology in the Nordic Countries*](https://fonologiinorden.wordpress.com/2023/08/09/fino-2024-call-for-abstracts/){target='_blank'} where I presented me and [Francesco Burroni](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/francescoburroni/home){target='_blank'}'s ongoing work on articulation of the Danish so-called 'soft *d*'. Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lhkyudvFLol1VY0WZOnSol8ewAOZAteIXMFxZZM1-dE/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}. I also co-presented a [poster](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/2024_fino_poster.pdf){target='_blank'} with [Maryann Tan](https://sultan8.github.io/){target='_blank'} on voicing rates and consonant-intrinsic *F*~0~ in Central Standard Swedish. Afterwards I stuck around the Multilingualism Lab and hung around with the great folks there for a few very productive days of working on said study about Central Standard Swedish. Thanks for having me!

////* I'm headed to to the [13th International Seminar on Speech Production](https://issp24.sciencesconf.org/){target='_blank'} in Autrans in May to further spread the word about [`praatpicture`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture){target='_blank'}, my R package for plotting acoustic data with time-aligned annotations. You can find an abstract [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/2024_issp.pdf){target='_blank'}. Hope to see you there!

//* [Menghui Shi](https://imoll.fudan.edu.cn/info/1088/1092.htm){target='_blank'} and I are hosting a [special session on segmental influences on prosody](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/sp2024/program/special-sessions#organizers-menghui-shi-and-rasmus-puggaard-rode){target='_blank'} at [Speech Prosody](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/sp2024){target='_blank'} in Leiden next summer. If you have any work on this, consider sending an abstract and a paper!

//* I had a great trip to the UK in spite of a [disastrous beginning to the journey](https://twitter.com/RPuggaardRode/status/1731804791737647554){target='_blank'} (which was Lufthansa's fault, not the UK's!). Saw some very interesting talks at the *Edinburgh Symposium on Historical Phonology*, and Henrik and I had some great conversations about [our poster](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/2023_eshp_poster.pdf){target='_blank'}. I had a wonderful trip to Lancaster afterwards, spending a few days with the extremely hospitable people from the [Phonetics Lab](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/phonetics/people/){target='_blank'}. I presented some of my work on phonetics--phonology interfacing in Jutland Danish stop gradation (slides are [here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/lancaster23/#/title-slide){target='_blank'}), and gave a demo of my R package  [`praatpicture`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture){target='_blank'}.
