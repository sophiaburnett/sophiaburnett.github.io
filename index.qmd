:::{#about-block}

Hi! I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronunced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Spoken Language Processing group led by [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/kirby_james/index.html){target='_blank'} at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html){target="_blank"}, where I'm working on a variety of topics, including microprosodic cues to obstruent voicing contrasts, microprosodic cues to laryngeal coda consonants, the articulatory dynamics of Danish consonants, and the development of software tools for processing and visualizing acoustic data. 

Most of my work (including [my dissertation](https://www.lotpublications.nl/stop-hey-whats-that-sound)) has dealt with the stop consonants of Danish. Colleagues and I have investigated [intervocalic voicing](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6449/){target="_blank"} and [spectral characteristics of stop releases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2022.101191){target="_blank"}, and used a large [legacy corpus of dialect recordings](https://dansklyd.statsbiblioteket.dk/samling/dialektsamlingen/){target="_blank"} to investigate regional variation in [voice onset time](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/JHN1Q7){target="_blank"}, closure voicing, and [characteristics of stop releases](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/icphs2023/){target='_blank'}. We have also proposed a new phonological analysis of the [infamous Danish stop-semivowel alternations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2021.2022866){target="_blank"}, suggesting that they are better understood as the outcome of sound change rather than synchronically active phonology.

I have also published on [information structure from an interactional linguistics perspective](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0332586519000088){target="_blank"}, [forensic phonetics](https://www.nys.dk/article/view/100580){target="_blank"}, [second language acquisition](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/isoctal-preprint.pdf){target="_blank"}, and [morphological change](https://doi.org/10.7146/sss.v11i2.123476){target="_blank"}.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

* I just got a back from a great week in Stockholm, where I first went to [*Phonology in the Nordic Countries*](https://fonologiinorden.wordpress.com/2023/08/09/fino-2024-call-for-abstracts/){target='_blank'} where I presented me and [Francesco Burroni](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/francescoburroni/home){target='_blank'}'s ongoing work on articulation of the Danish so-called 'soft *d*'. Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lhkyudvFLol1VY0WZOnSol8ewAOZAteIXMFxZZM1-dE/edit?usp=sharing){target='_blank'}. I also co-presented a [poster](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/2024_fino_poster.pdf){target='_blank'} with [Maryann Tan](https://sultan8.github.io/){target='_blank'} on voicing rates and consonant-intrinsic *F*~0~ in Central Standard Swedish. Afterwards I stuck around the Multilingualism Lab and hung around with the great folks there for a few very productive days of working on said study about Central Standard Swedish. Thanks for having me!

* I'm headed to to the [13th International Seminar on Speech Production](https://issp24.sciencesconf.org/){target='_blank'} in Autrans in May to further spread the word about [`praatpicture`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture){target='_blank'}, my R package for plotting acoustic data with time-aligned annotations. You can find an abstract [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/2024_issp.pdf){target='_blank'}. Hope to see you there!

* [Menghui Shi](https://imoll.fudan.edu.cn/info/1088/1092.htm){target='_blank'} and I are hosting a [special session on segmental influences on prosody](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/sp2024/program/special-sessions#organizers-menghui-shi-and-rasmus-puggaard-rode){target='_blank'} at [Speech Prosody](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/sp2024){target='_blank'} in Leiden next summer. If you have any work on this, consider sending an abstract and a paper!

* I had a great trip to the UK in spite of a [disastrous beginning to the journey](https://twitter.com/RPuggaardRode/status/1731804791737647554){target='_blank'} (which was Lufthansa's fault, not the UK's!). Saw some very interesting talks at the *Edinburgh Symposium on Historical Phonology*, and Henrik and I had some great conversations about [our poster](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/2023_eshp_poster.pdf){target='_blank'}. I had a wonderful trip to Lancaster afterwards, spending a few days with the extremely hospitable people from the [Phonetics Lab](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/phonetics/people/){target='_blank'}. I presented some of my work on phonetics--phonology interfacing in Jutland Danish stop gradation (slides are [here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/lancaster23/#/title-slide){target='_blank'}), and gave a demo of my R package  [`praatpicture`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture){target='_blank'}.

* I'm heading to [*Phonology in the Nordic Countries*](https://fonologiinorden.wordpress.com/2023/08/09/fino-2024-call-for-abstracts/){target='_blank'} in Stockholm in February. I'll be presenting a talk about the articulation of the unusual Danish semivowel known as 'the soft *d*' with my colleague Francesco Burroni, and a poster on obstruent-intrinsic *F*0 in Central Swedish with Maryann Tan and James Kirby.
